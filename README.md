# COIT20280
Data Analysis Student Resources

This project stores most of the resources students need in COIT20280. In this course we rely on Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis. The prime purpose of this project is to act as a repository for all the Jupyter Notebook assessment items. Many of the modules in COIT20280 have an associated Jupyter Notebook that you will have to complete. For example, if Module 6 has an assessable Jupyter Notebook that has to be completed you will find a file named 'Module 6.ipynb' here in this project. Download this file, complete the exercises contained within it and submit the completed Jupyter Notebook in the COIT20280 online submission area.
